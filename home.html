    <h2> Welcome! </h2>
      <p> This is my Countless Notebooks Eliminator website, and I'm so glad you're here!
          I tend to put a lot of random information and lists and such into notebooks,
          <br>but I'm getting sick of carrying all of them around with the number of times I have and
          will have to move. To solve this, I decided to create a website housing
          <br>all of this information in one place (as well as to learn some web development) and that's what
          this place is. It's all organized into overarching topics; see below
          <br>for a brief description of what can be found where. </p>

    <h2> Portfolio </h2>
      <p> this is basically just a bunch of resume information </p>
    <h2> Pastimes </h2>
      <p> this includes description/updates on my hobbies and other activities </p>
    <h2> Curated </h2>
      <p> basically just a bunch of shit I like as well as other ranked lists or recommendations </p>
    <h2> Gallery </h2>
      <p> pictures, maybe they're sorted, maybe they aren't. Guess youll just have to see </p>
    <h2> Contact </h2>
      <p> Need to contact me? Want to contact me? Please don't. </p>
