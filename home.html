            <h2> Welcome! </h2>
              <p> This is my Countless Notebooks Eliminator website, and I'm so glad you're here!
                I tend to put a lot of random information and lists and such into notebooks,
                but I'm getting sick of carrying all of them around with the number of times I have and
                will have to move. To solve this, I decided to create a website housing
                all of this information in one place (as well as to learn some web development) and that's what
                this place is. It's all organized into overarching topics; see below
                for a brief description of what can be found where. </p>

          <h2> Portfolio </h2>
            <p> This page contains the sort of information that I might include on a resume. Things such as education,
                past jobs, research, academic projects, etc. can be found here. </p>

            <p> Here you can find out about what sorts of hobbies and activities I'm interested in, as well as updates
                on certain topics, such as my aquariums, sewing projects, or other activities. </p>
